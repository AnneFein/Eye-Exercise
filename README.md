# Eye-Exercise

This exercise uses an .onmousemove event to simulate the movement of two eyes, when a mouse is moved over them on the screen. The eyes will follow the direction of the mouse, in any direction. Technologies used: JavaScript ES6, HTML, and CSS.

**How to Run**

This application runs in the browser. Move your mouse over the eyes, and the eyes will move to follow the movements of the mouse.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**

In the future, I would like to add colored irises to surround the pupils, so that they move with the pupils. I would also like to add a face to surround the eyes.
